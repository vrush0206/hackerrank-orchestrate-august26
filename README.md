# HackerRank Orchestrate

Starter repository for the **HackerRank Orchestrate** 24-hour hackathon.

## Message Notification Router

Build an AI-powered system for WhatsApp that decides which messages deserve immediate attention, which should wait, and which should be muted.

The system must reason over multimodal messages, including text messages, image posters/screenshots, and voice notes.

WhatsApp is noisy. A user can receive family chats, society notices, school updates, co-worker messages, business account promotions, image posters, voice notes, and scams in the same message stream. Treating every message the same creates two bad outcomes: important messages get missed, and unwanted or risky messages interrupt the user.

Read [`problem_statement.md`](./problem_statement.md) for the full task spec, input/output schema, allowed values, and submission format.

## Implemented Solution

The `agent/message-router-dashboard` branch contains a production-oriented TypeScript implementation built with the Vercel AI SDK, Gemini, Zod, and UI5 Web Components for React.

### Routing pipeline

- Streams `dataset/messages.csv` instead of loading the full message file into memory.
- Indexes users, preferences, groups, business metadata, media mappings, notification summaries, and interaction history through typed lookup maps.
- Retrieves the five most relevant historical messages using a weighted score: 45% lexical similarity, 30% recency, and 25% interaction strength.
- Sends enriched messages to Gemini in configurable batches, with image assets encoded as multimodal content parts.
- Validates every decision with a strict Zod schema before progressively writing output.
- Restricts actions to `notify`, `digest`, or `mute` and message categories to the challenge's exact allowed values.

### Reliability and validation

- Applies configurable requests-per-minute pacing and stops after two consecutive request failures by default.
- Preserves runtime errors in dashboard history and a local JSONL log.
- Writes production results to `dataset/output.pending.csv` and promotes them to `dataset/output.csv` only after a complete successful run.
- Checks row counts, missing and duplicate message IDs, schema compliance, and zero-confidence decisions.
- Archives completed runs under the gitignored `code/run-output/` directory.

### UI5 monitoring dashboard

Running `npm start` launches a SAP UI5 React dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. It provides:

- **Data Overview** for source-data distributions and indexed-record statistics.
- **Run Control** for starting a run and monitoring progress, decisions, model configuration, and persistent failures.
- **Implementation Workflow** for explaining context aggregation, ranked historical retrieval, batching, multimodal enrichment, and output validation.

The interface uses UI5 `ShellBar`, `TabContainer`, `Card`, `ObjectStatus`, `ProgressIndicator`, `MessageStrip`, `List`, and icon components with SAP theme tokens.

### Run the implementation

```powershell
cd code
npm ci
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Set GEMINI_API_KEY in .env, then:
npm run test:offline
npm start
```

See [`code/README.md`](./code/README.md) for model, batching, rate-limit, smoke-test, and headless-run configuration.

## What You Need to Build

For every row in `dataset/messages.csv`, produce one row in `output.csv` with:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `message_id` | Incoming message ID |
| `action` | One of `notify`, `digest`, or `mute` |
| `message_type` | Best-fit message category |
| `reason` | Short human-readable explanation |
| `confidence` | Number from `0` to `1` |
| `evidence_message_ids` | Historical message IDs used as evidence; write `none` if there is no useful evidence |

Your system should make personalized decisions using the provided message, user, group, business, media, and historical interaction data.
For image and voice-note messages, `images.csv` and `voice_notes.csv` only provide file paths; your system should inspect the media files themselves.

---

## Suggested Workflow

1. Inspect `dataset/sample_messages.csv` to understand the expected output format.
2. Load `dataset/messages.csv` and all relevant context files.
3. Build your routing system using any approach: LLMs, retrieval, rules, classifiers, agents, or hybrids.
4. Write predictions to `output.csv`.
5. Evaluate your approach on the solved sample rows before submitting.

You may use any language or runtime. Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript are all reasonable choices.

---

## Requirements

Your solution must:

- be runnable from the terminal
- read the provided files from `dataset/`
- produce a valid `output.csv`
- include one prediction for every `message_id` in `dataset/messages.csv`
- not use organizer-only files or hardcoded labels

If you use API keys or secrets, read them from environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in the repo.

---

## Evaluation

Your `output.csv` will be compared against hidden ground-truth labels.

The scoring will consider:

- correctness of `action`
- correctness of `message_type`
- usefulness and consistency of `reason`
- whether `evidence_message_ids` point to relevant historical messages
- reasonable confidence calibration

Strong systems will combine retrieval, structured metadata, behavioral history, safety checks, OCR/ASR handling, and contextual reasoning.

## Chat Transcript Logging

This repo includes an [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) file for AI coding tools. It asks compatible tools to append conversation summaries to:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `$HOME/hackerrank_orchestrate_august26/log.txt` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\hackerrank_orchestrate_august26\log.txt` |

Upload this log as your chat transcript at submission time. Do not paste secrets into the chat.

---

## Submission

Submit the following files as instructed by HackerRank:

1. **Code zip**: full runnable solution, prompts/configs, README, and any evaluation files.
2. **Predictions CSV**: final `output.csv` for all rows in `dataset/messages.csv`.
3. **Chat transcript**: the `log.txt` described above.

Before submitting, confirm:

- `output.csv` has one row per row in `dataset/messages.csv`.
- `output.csv` has the exact required columns in the exact required order.
- Your runnable code and setup instructions are included in `code.zip`.
